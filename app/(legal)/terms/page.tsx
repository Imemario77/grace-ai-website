              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Generally</h3>
              <p>
                In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Grace AI Solution in the most expedient and cost
                effective manner, and except as expressly described herein, you and Grace AI Solution agree that every
                dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is
                less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury,
                may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
                Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate
                disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in
                contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether
                a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY
                ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND GRACE AI SOLUTION ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
                PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Exceptions</h3>
              <p>
                Despite the provisions of this Section, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or
                otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b)
                pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is
                available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a
                court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Opt-Out</h3>
              <p>
                If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this
                Section within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Grace AI
                Solution., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 2326 Washington Blvd., #303, Ogden, UT
                84409 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the
                Services, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration ("Opt-Out Notice"). Once Grace AI
                Solution receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section will be void and any action arising out of these
                Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 14 ("Governing Law") The remaining provisions of these
                Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Arbitrator</h3>
              <p>
                Any arbitration between you and Grace AI Solution will be settled by a single arbitrator under the
                Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its
                Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, "AAA Rules") as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and
                filing forms are available online at https://www.adr.org/, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by
                contacting Grace AI Solution. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to
                the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Notice of Arbitration; Process</h3>
              <p>
                A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other
                party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has
                not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("Notice of Arbitration"). Grace AI
                Solution's address for Notice of Arbitration is: Grace AI Solution, 135 W Pumping Station Rd,
                Quakertown, PA 18951 The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
                dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith
                efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30
                days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Grace AI Solution may commence an arbitration
                proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed
                by the parties in writing and will take place in Quakertown, PA. During the arbitration, the amount of
                any settlement offer made by you or Grace AI Solution must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
                after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount
                higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Grace AI Solution in settlement of the dispute
                prior to the award, Grace AI Solution will pay to you the higher of: (c) the amount awarded by the
                arbitrator and (d) US$10,000.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Fees</h3>
              <p>
                If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Grace AI Solution will reimburse you for
                your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the payment
                of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to
                be agreed upon in the county and state of your residence or billing address, but if the claim is for
                US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of
                documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by
                an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your permanent
                residence. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the
                Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
                Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
                In that case, you agree to reimburse Grace AI Solution for all monies previously disbursed by it that
                are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
                arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain
                the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The
                arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses
                at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
                arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">No Class Actions</h3>
              <p className="font-bold">
                YOU AND GRACE AI SOLUTION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS
                INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
                PROCEEDING.

              <p className="mt-4">
                Further, unless both you and Grace AI Solution agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more
                than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
                proceeding.
              </p>

              <p>
                If Grace AI Solution makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Grace
                AI Solution's address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice
                within 30 days of the change to Grace AI Solution' address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your
                account with Grace AI Solution will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in
                effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

              <p>
                If Section 12(g) ("No Class Actions") or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, or
                if Grace AI Solution receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section will be null
                and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 14 ("Governing
                Law") will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
